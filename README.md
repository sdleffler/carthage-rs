# Carthage: RDF graph manipulation and parsing for Rust

*We're still a little salty about Rome.*

Carthage is a work-in-progress RDF graph parsing and manipulation library for
Rust, being built for use in [Attaca](https://github.com/attaca/attaca).

Eventual goals:
- [ ] Robust N-triples and Turtle parsers capable of passing the W3C test suites.
- [ ] N-triples and Turtle formatting capable of outputting "canonical forms" of graphs.
- [ ] Simple, in-memory RDF graph manipulation.
